#### Mission Statement
Modern States Education Alliance is a non-profit organization committed to making high quality college education accessible and affordable for every person. By offering free and accredited online courses that prepare students for CLEP (College Level Examination Program) exams, Modern States helps learners earn real college credit and accelerate their degree progress without the burden of tuition costs.

#### About Modern States
Modern States partners with leading universities, professors, and the College Board to create a comprehensive digital library of more than 30 introductory college courses. These courses mirror standard first-year college classes and prepare learners to pass CLEP exams accepted by over 2,900 colleges and universities.

#### About Our Project
Our project supports Modern States' mission by addressing one of the biggest challenges facing learners: the lack of clarity around CLEP credit acceptance policies across colleges and universities.

We are building a searchable, scalable CLEP Acceptance Dashboard that:
- Aggregates verified data on which institutions accept specific CLEP exams
- Displays each college's credit policy, required scores, and last update date
- Enables learners, advisors, and institutions to contribute verified updates
- Provides transparency through a trusted, easy-to-use interface

By improving visibility and trust in CLEP transfer information, our project strengthens Modern States goal of turning free learning into real, transferable college credit, ultimately helping more students earn their degrees faster, with less debt, and greater confidence in their path.
